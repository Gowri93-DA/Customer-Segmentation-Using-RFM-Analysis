# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-Analysis
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and identify high-value and at-risk segments.  The goal is to transform raw transaction data into actionable customer insights.

# Objective:
Identify high-value customers  
Detect customers at risk of churn  
Understand revenue concentration  
Support targeted retention strategies  

# Methodology: Customers were evaluated using:
Recency – Days since last purchase  
Frequency – Number of purchases  
Monetary – Total spending  
Each customer was scored on a 1–5 scale and grouped into segments such as:  
  
 # Champions | Big Spenders | Loyal Customers | At Risk | Lost | Others  

# Key Insights:  
💰 Total Revenue: ~$1.96M  
👥 Total Customers: 789  
🏆 Champions contribute ~33% of total revenue  
💎 Big Spenders contribute ~25%   
📈 High-value segments drive ~73% of overall revenue  
⚠ At-Risk customers represent ~$141K in potential revenue  

 # Insight: Revenue is highly concentrated among a small group of high-value customers, while a measurable portion of revenue is exposed to churn risk.  

# Business Impact:  
Focus retention efforts on Champions  
Increase engagement of Big Spenders  
Re-engage At-Risk customers  
Apply upsell strategies to mid-value segments  

# Tools Used  
Power BI  
RFM Segmentation Methodology  
Data Modeling & KPI Analysis  

# Takeaway

RFM segmentation enables data-driven customer strategy by identifying revenue drivers and churn risks, allowing businesses to take targeted actions instead of applying one-size-fits-all marketing.
